<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">Welcome.</span>
<span class="err">Can I turn this on?</span>
<span class="err">Maybe, all right.</span>
<span class="err">Can people hear in the back?</span>
<span class="err">Can you guys hear me?</span>
<span class="err">Is the mic on?</span>
<span class="err">No, ah, maybe you can ask them to turn it on.</span>
<span class="err">Maybe we can get a bigger, ah, there we go.</span>
<span class="err">All right.</span>
<span class="err">Maybe we can get a bigger auditorium, we&#39;ll see.</span>
<span class="err">So welcome to CS183B.</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;m Sam Altman.</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;m the President of Y Combinator.</span>
<span class="err">Nine years ago, I was a Stanford student and</span>
<span class="err">then I dropped out to start a company.</span>
<span class="err">And then I&#39;ve been an investor for the last few.</span>
<span class="err">So, at YC, we&#39;ve been teaching people how to</span>
<span class="err">start startups for nine years.</span>
<span class="err">Most of it&#39;s very hands on and</span>
<span class="err">specific to the startups.</span>
<span class="err">But, 30% of it is pretty generally applicable.</span>
<span class="err">And so, we think that we</span>
<span class="err">can teach that 30% in this class.</span>
<span class="err">And even though that&#39;s only 30% of the way</span>
<span class="err">there hopefully it&#39;ll still be really helpful.</span>
<span class="err">We&#39;ve taught a lot of this at YC already, but</span>
<span class="err">it&#39;s all been off the record.</span>
<span class="err">And this is the first time that a lot of what we</span>
<span class="err">teach in YC is gonna be on the record.</span>
<span class="err">So we&#39;ve invited some of our best speakers to come and</span>
<span class="err">give the same talks they give at YC.</span>
<span class="err">We&#39;ve now funded 720 companies.</span>
<span class="err">And so, we&#39;re pretty sure</span>
<span class="err">that a lot of this advice is pretty good.</span>
<span class="err">We can&#39;t fund every startup yet, but we can</span>
<span class="err">hopefully make this advice very generally available.</span>
<span class="err">Guest speakers are gonna teach 17 of the 20 classes.</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;m only teaching three.</span>
<span class="err">Counting YC itself,</span>
<span class="err">every guest speaker has been involved in the creation of</span>
<span class="err">a billion plus dollar company.</span>
<span class="err">So the advice shouldn&#39;t be that theoretical.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s all been, it&#39;s all from people who have done it.</span>
<span class="err">All of the advice in</span>
<span class="err">this class is geared towards people starting a business</span>
<span class="err">where the goal was hyper-growth.</span>
<span class="err">And eventually building a very large company.</span>
<span class="err">Much of it doesn&#39;t apply in other cases and</span>
<span class="err">I wanna warn people up front.</span>
<span class="err">That if you try and</span>
<span class="err">do these things in a lot of big companies or</span>
<span class="err">non startups, it won&#39;t work.</span>
<span class="err">It should still be interesting.</span>
<span class="err">I, I really do think that startups are the way of</span>
<span class="err">the future and it&#39;s worth trying to understand them.</span>
<span class="err">But startups are very different</span>
<span class="err">than normal companies.</span>
<span class="err">So over the course of today and</span>
<span class="err">Thursday, I&#39;m gonna try to give an overview of the four</span>
<span class="err">areas that you need to excel at in order to</span>
<span class="err">maximize your chances of success at a startup.</span>
<span class="err">And then throughout the course, the guest speakers</span>
<span class="err">are gonna drill into all of these in more detail.</span>
<span class="err">So the four areas, you need a great idea,</span>
<span class="err">a great product, a great team and great execution.</span>
<span class="err">These overlap somewhat, but I&#39;m gonna have to talk about</span>
<span class="err">them somewhat individually to make it make sense.</span>
<span class="err">You may still fail.</span>
<span class="err">The outcome is something like idea times product</span>
<span class="err">times execution times team times luck,</span>
<span class="err">where luck is the random number between 0 and 10,000.</span>
<span class="err">Literally that much.</span>
<span class="err">But if you do really well in the four areas you can</span>
<span class="err">control, you have a good chance of at</span>
<span class="err">least some amount of success.</span>
<span class="err">One of the exciting things about startups, is</span>
<span class="err">that they are surprisingly even playing field.</span>
<span class="err">Young and inexperienced, you can do this.</span>
<span class="err">Old and very experienced, you can do this too.</span>
<span class="err">And one of the things that I particularly like about</span>
<span class="err">startups is that some of the things that are bad in</span>
<span class="err">other work situations, like being poor and unknown are</span>
<span class="err">actually huge assets when it comes to starting a startup.</span>
<span class="err">Before we jump in on the how.</span>
<span class="err">I want to talk about why you should start a startup.</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;m somewhat hesitant to be doing this class at all,</span>
<span class="err">because you should never start a startup just for</span>
<span class="err">the sake of doing so.</span>
<span class="err">There are much easier ways to get rich and</span>
<span class="err">everyone who starts a startup always says,</span>
<span class="err">always, that they couldn&#39;t have imagined how hard and</span>
<span class="err">painful it was going to be.</span>
<span class="err">You should only start a startup if you com,</span>
<span class="err">feel compelled by a particular problem.</span>
<span class="err">And that you think starting a company is</span>
<span class="err">the best way to solve it.</span>
<span class="err">The specific passion should come first and</span>
<span class="err">the startup second.</span>
<span class="err">In fact, all of</span>
<span class="err">the big successes we have at YC followed this.</span>
<span class="err">So, for the second half of today&#39;s lecture,</span>
<span class="err">Dustin Moskovitz the co-founder of Facebook and</span>
<span class="err">Asana, is going to take over and</span>
<span class="err">talk about why to start a startup.</span>
<span class="err">We&#39;re so surprised by the amount of</span>
<span class="err">attention that this class got.</span>
<span class="err">That we wanna make sure we</span>
<span class="err">spend a lot of time on the why.</span>
<span class="err">Okay. So</span>
<span class="err">the first of the four areas.</span>
<span class="err">A great idea.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s become popular in</span>
<span class="err">recent years to say that the idea doesn&#39;t matter.</span>
<span class="err">In fact, it&#39;s almost uncool to spend a lot of time</span>
<span class="err">thinking about the idea for a startup.</span>
<span class="err">You&#39;re just supposed to start.</span>
<span class="err">Throw stuff at the walls.</span>
<span class="err">See what sticks.</span>
<span class="err">And not even spend any time thinking about if</span>
<span class="err">it&#39;ll be valuable if it works.</span>
<span class="err">And pivots are supposed to be great.</span>
<span class="err">The more pivots, the better.</span>
<span class="err">So this isn&#39;t totally wrong.</span>
<span class="err">Things do evolve in</span>
<span class="err">ways that are difficult to predict.</span>
<span class="err">And there&#39;s a limit to how much you can figure out,</span>
<span class="err">without actually getting a product in</span>
<span class="err">the hands of users.</span>
<span class="err">And great execution is at</span>
<span class="err">least ten times more important and</span>
<span class="err">a hundred times harder than a good idea.</span>
<span class="err">But the pendulum has swung way out of whack here.</span>
<span class="err">A bad idea is still bad.</span>
<span class="err">In the pivot happy world that we&#39;re in today,</span>
<span class="err">it feels really sub optimal.</span>
<span class="err">Great execution towards a terrible idea</span>
<span class="err">will get you nowhere.</span>
<span class="err">There are exceptions, of course.</span>
<span class="err">But most great companies start with</span>
<span class="err">a great idea, not a pivot.</span>
<span class="err">If you look at successful pivots, they almost always</span>
<span class="err">are a pivot into something the founders</span>
<span class="err">themselves wanted, not a random made up idea.</span>
<span class="err">Airbnb happened because Brian Chesky couldn&#39;t pay</span>
<span class="err">his rent, but he did have some extra space.</span>
<span class="err">In general, though,</span>
<span class="err">if you look at the track record of pivots,</span>
<span class="err">they don&#39;t become big companies.</span>
<span class="err">I myself used to believe ideas didn&#39;t matter that</span>
<span class="err">much, but I&#39;m very sure that&#39;s wrong now.</span>
<span class="err">The definition of the idea,</span>
<span class="err">as we talk about it, is very broad.</span>
<span class="err">It includes the size and the growth of the market,</span>
<span class="err">the growth strategy for the company,</span>
<span class="err">the defensibility strategy and so on.</span>
<span class="err">When you&#39;re evaluating an idea,</span>
<span class="err">you need to think through all these things,</span>
<span class="err">not just the product.</span>
<span class="err">If it works out, you&#39;re gonna be working on this for</span>
<span class="err">ten years.</span>
<span class="err">So it&#39;s worth some real upfront time</span>
<span class="err">to think we&#39;ve a long term value in</span>
<span class="err">the defensibility of the business.</span>
<span class="err">Even though plans themselves are worthless,</span>
<span class="err">to exercise a planning is really valuable and</span>
<span class="err">totally missing in most startups today.</span>
<span class="err">Long term thinking is so where,</span>
<span class="err">anywhere, but especially in startups.</span>
<span class="err">That it&#39;s a huge advantage if you do it.</span>
<span class="err">Remember that the idea will expand and</span>
<span class="err">become more ambitious as you go.</span>
<span class="err">You certainly don&#39;t need to have everything figured out,</span>
<span class="err">in a path from here to world domination.</span>
<span class="err">But you really want a nice kernel to start with.</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; You want something that can develop in</span>
<span class="err">interesting ways.</span>
<span class="err">As you&#39;re thinking through ideas,</span>
<span class="err">another thing that we see young founders get</span>
<span class="err">wrong all the time, is that someday you need to</span>
<span class="err">build a business that&#39;s difficult to replicate.</span>
<span class="err">This is an important part of a good idea.</span>
<span class="err">I wanna make this point again because it&#39;s</span>
<span class="err">so important.</span>
<span class="err">The idea should come first, and</span>
<span class="err">the startup should come second.</span>
<span class="err">Wait to start a startup, until you come up</span>
<span class="err">with an idea you feel compelled to explore.</span>
<span class="err">This is also the way to</span>
<span class="err">chose between multiple ideas.</span>
<span class="err">If you have several ideas that all seem pretty good,</span>
<span class="err">work on the one that you think about most often when</span>
<span class="err">you&#39;re not trying to think about work.</span>
<span class="err">But we hear again and again from founders that they</span>
<span class="err">wish they had waited to start a startup until they</span>
<span class="err">came up with an idea that they really loved.</span>
<span class="err">Another way of looking at this is that the best</span>
<span class="err">companies are almost always mission oriented.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s difficult to get large groups of people to</span>
<span class="err">the extreme levels of focus and productivity that you</span>
<span class="err">need for a startup to be successful,</span>
<span class="err">unless the company feels like an important mission.</span>
<span class="err">And it&#39;s usually really hard to get that without a great</span>
<span class="err">founding idea.</span>
<span class="err">A related advantage of mission oriented</span>
<span class="err">ideas is that you yourself will be dedicated to them.</span>
<span class="err">It takes years and</span>
<span class="err">years, usually a decade to create a great startup.</span>
<span class="err">If you don&#39;t love and</span>
<span class="err">believe in what you&#39;re building,</span>
<span class="err">you&#39;re likely to give up at some point along the way.</span>
<span class="err">There&#39;s no way I know of to get through the pain of a</span>
<span class="err">startup without belief that the mission really matters.</span>
<span class="err">A lot of founders, especially students,</span>
<span class="err">believe that their startup&#39;s only gonna take two or</span>
<span class="err">three years and then after that they&#39;ll work on</span>
<span class="err">what they&#39;re really passionate about.</span>
<span class="err">That almost never works.</span>
<span class="err">Good startups usually take ten years.</span>
<span class="err">A third advantage of mission-oriented</span>
<span class="err">companies is that people outside the company,</span>
<span class="err">are more willing to help you.</span>
<span class="err">You&#39;ll get more support on</span>
<span class="err">a hard important project than a derivative one.</span>
<span class="err">When it comes to starting startups,</span>
<span class="err">in many ways it&#39;s easier to</span>
<span class="err">start a hard startup than an easy startup.</span>
<span class="err">This is one of those counter-intuitive things.</span>
<span class="err">It takes people a long time to understand.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s difficult to overstate how</span>
<span class="err">important being mission-driven is, so</span>
<span class="err">I wanna emphasize it one last time.</span>
<span class="err">Derivative companies, companies that</span>
<span class="err">copy an existing idea with very few new insights,</span>
<span class="err">don&#39;t excite people and they don&#39;t compel the teams to</span>
<span class="err">work hard enough to be successful.</span>
<span class="err">Paul Graham is gonna talk about how to</span>
<span class="err">get startup ideas next week.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s something that a lot of founders struggle with but</span>
<span class="err">it&#39;s something I believe you can get better with it,</span>
<span class="err">better at with practice.</span>
<span class="err">And it&#39;s definitely worth trying to get better at.</span>
<span class="err">The hardest part about coming up</span>
<span class="err">with great ideas is that</span>
<span class="err">the best ideas often look terrible at the beginning.</span>
<span class="err">The 13th search engine and</span>
<span class="err">without all the features of web portal.</span>
<span class="err">Most people thought that was pointless, search was done,</span>
<span class="err">and anyway, it didn&#39;t matter that much,</span>
<span class="err">Portal&#39;s where the value is at.</span>
<span class="err">The tenth social network, and</span>
<span class="err">limited only to college students with no money?</span>
<span class="err">Also terrible.</span>
<span class="err">MySpace had won, and</span>
<span class="err">who wants college students as customers, or</span>
<span class="err">a way to stay on strangers&#39; couches?</span>
<span class="err">That just sounds terrible all around.</span>
<span class="err">These all sounded really bad,</span>
<span class="err">but they turned out to be good.</span>
<span class="err">If they had sounded really good,</span>
<span class="err">there would have been too many people working on them.</span>
<span class="err">As Peter Tills discussed in the fifth class,</span>
<span class="err">you want an idea that turns into a monopoly, but</span>
<span class="err">you can&#39;t get a monopoly in a big market right away.</span>
<span class="err">Too much competition for that.</span>
<span class="err">You have to find a small market in which you can get</span>
<span class="err">a monopoly, and then quickly expand.</span>
<span class="err">This is why some great startup ideas look</span>
<span class="err">really bad at the beginning.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s good if you can say something like, today only</span>
<span class="err">the small subset of users are going to use my product.</span>
<span class="err">But I&#39;m gonna get all of them.</span>
<span class="err">And in the future,</span>
<span class="err">almost everyone will use my product.</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s the thing that&#39;s gonna come up a lot,</span>
<span class="err">you need conviction in your own beliefs, and</span>
<span class="err">the willingness to ignore others nay saying.</span>
<span class="err">The hard part is that this is a very fine line.</span>
<span class="err">There&#39;s right on one side of it, and crazy on the other.</span>
<span class="err">But keep in mind that if you do come up with</span>
<span class="err">a great idea, most people are going to think it&#39;s bad.</span>
<span class="err">You should be happy about that.</span>
<span class="err">It means they won&#39;t compete with you.</span>
<span class="err">This is also a reason why it&#39;s</span>
<span class="err">not usually dangerous to tell people about your idea.</span>
<span class="err">The truly good ideas don&#39;t sound like</span>
<span class="err">they&#39;re worth stealing.</span>
<span class="err">You want an idea about which you can say,</span>
<span class="err">I know it sounds like a bad idea.</span>
<span class="err">But hear specifically why it&#39;s actually a great one.</span>
<span class="err">You wanna sound crazy, but you wanna actually be right.</span>
<span class="err">And you want an idea that not many</span>
<span class="err">other people are working on.</span>
<span class="err">And it&#39;s okay if it doesn&#39;t sound big at first.</span>
<span class="err">Common mistake among founders,</span>
<span class="err">especially first time founders,</span>
<span class="err">is they think that the first version of their product,</span>
<span class="err">the first version of their idea,</span>
<span class="err">needs to sound really big.</span>
<span class="err">But it doesn&#39;t.</span>
<span class="err">It needs to take over a small,</span>
<span class="err">specific market and expand from there.</span>
<span class="err">That&#39;s how most great companies have started.</span>
<span class="err">Unpopular but right is what you&#39;re going for.</span>
<span class="err">You want something that sounds like a bad idea, but</span>
<span class="err">is a good idea.</span>
<span class="err">You also really wanna take the time to</span>
<span class="err">think about how the market&#39;s going to evolve.</span>
<span class="err">You need a market that&#39;s going to be big in</span>
<span class="err">ten years.</span>
<span class="err">Most investors are obsessed with the market size today,</span>
<span class="err">and they don&#39;t think at all about how the market is</span>
<span class="err">going to evolve.</span>
<span class="err">In fact, I think this is one of the biggest</span>
<span class="err">systemic mistakes that investors make.</span>
<span class="err">They think about the growth of the startup itself,</span>
<span class="err">they don&#39;t think about the growth of the market.</span>
<span class="err">I care much more about the growth rate of</span>
<span class="err">the market than it&#39;s current size.</span>
<span class="err">And I also care if</span>
<span class="err">there&#39;s any reason that it&#39;s gonna top out.</span>
<span class="err">You should think about this.</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;d prefer to invest in</span>
<span class="err">a company that&#39;s going after a small but</span>
<span class="err">rapidly growing market than a big but slow growing one.</span>
<span class="err">One of the big advantages of these sorts of markets um,</span>
<span class="err">these small but rapidly growing markets, is that</span>
<span class="err">customers are usually pretty desperate for a solution.</span>
<span class="err">And they&#39;ll put, put up with an imperfect but</span>
<span class="err">rapidly improving product.</span>
<span class="err">And a big advantage of being a student, one of</span>
<span class="err">the two biggest advantages is that you probably have</span>
<span class="err">better intuition about which markets are likely to</span>
<span class="err">start growing rapidly than older people do.</span>
<span class="err">Another thing that students usually don&#39;t understand, or</span>
<span class="err">at least takes a while you cannot create a market that</span>
<span class="err">doesn&#39;t want to exist.</span>
<span class="err">You can basically change everything in</span>
<span class="err">a startup but the market.</span>
<span class="err">So you should actually do some thinking, to be sure or</span>
<span class="err">at least as sure as you can be, that the market your</span>
<span class="err">going after is going to grow and be there.</span>
<span class="err">There are a lot of different ways to</span>
<span class="err">talk about the right kind of market.</span>
<span class="err">For example, surfing someone else&#39;s wave or</span>
<span class="err">stepping into an up elevator or being part of a movement.</span>
<span class="err">But all of this is just a way of saying you want</span>
<span class="err">a market that&#39;s going to grow really quickly.</span>
<span class="err">It may seem small today.</span>
<span class="err">It may be small today.</span>
<span class="err">But you know, and</span>
<span class="err">other people don&#39;t that it&#39;s gonna grow really fast.</span>
<span class="err">So think about where this is happening in the world.</span>
<span class="err">You need this sort of</span>
<span class="err">a tail wind to make a startup successful.</span>
<span class="err">The exciting thing is there are probably more of</span>
<span class="err">these tail winds now than ever before.</span>
<span class="err">As Mark Andreessen says,</span>
<span class="err">software is eating the world.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s just everywhere.</span>
<span class="err">There are like, so many great ideas out there and</span>
<span class="err">you just have to pick one, and</span>
<span class="err">find one that you really care about.</span>
<span class="err">Another version of this,</span>
<span class="err">that would, gets down to the same idea,</span>
<span class="err">is Sequoia&#39;s famous question.</span>
<span class="err">Why now?</span>
<span class="err">Why is this the perfect time for this particular idea and</span>
<span class="err">to start this particular company?</span>
<span class="err">Why couldn&#39;t it have been done two years ago?</span>
<span class="err">And why will two years in the future be too late?</span>
<span class="err">For the most successful startups we&#39;ve been</span>
<span class="err">involved with, they&#39;ve all had a great idea,</span>
<span class="err">great answer to this question.</span>
<span class="err">And if you don&#39;t, you should be at</span>
<span class="err">least somewhat suspicious about it.</span>
<span class="err">In general, it&#39;s best if</span>
<span class="err">you&#39;re building something that you yourself need.</span>
<span class="err">You&#39;ll understand it much better than if you have to</span>
<span class="err">understand it by talking to</span>
<span class="err">a customer to build the very first version.</span>
<span class="err">If you don&#39;t know it yourself and</span>
<span class="err">you&#39;re building something that someone else needs,</span>
<span class="err">realize that you&#39;re at a big disadvantage and get very,</span>
<span class="err">very close to your customers.</span>
<span class="err">Try to work in their office if you can.</span>
<span class="err">And if not, talk to them multiple times a day.</span>
<span class="err">Another somewhat counter-intuitive thing</span>
<span class="err">about good start up ideas,</span>
<span class="err">is that they&#39;re almost always very easy to explain,</span>
<span class="err">and very easy to understand.</span>
<span class="err">If it takes more than a sentence to</span>
<span class="err">explain what you&#39;re doing um,</span>
<span class="err">it&#39;s almost always a sign that it&#39;s too complicated.</span>
<span class="err">It should be a clearly articulate,</span>
<span class="err">articulated vision with a small number of words.</span>
<span class="err">And the best ideas are usually either,</span>
<span class="err">very different from existing companies in one</span>
<span class="err">important way.</span>
<span class="err">Like Google being a search engine that worked</span>
<span class="err">just really well and none of the other stuff of</span>
<span class="err">the portals or totally new, like Space X.</span>
<span class="err">Any company that&#39;s a clone of</span>
<span class="err">something else that already exists with some small or</span>
<span class="err">made up differentiator,</span>
<span class="err">like we&#39;re gonna be x beautiful design or</span>
<span class="err">we&#39;re gonna be y for people that like red wine instead.</span>
<span class="err">That usually fails.</span>
<span class="err">So as I mentioned one of the great things about being</span>
<span class="err">a student is you</span>
<span class="err">have a very good perspective on new technology.</span>
<span class="err">And learning to get good at having new</span>
<span class="err">ideas takes a while.</span>
<span class="err">So start working on that right now.</span>
<span class="err">That&#39;s one thing we hear from people all the time,</span>
<span class="err">that they wish they had</span>
<span class="err">done more when they were a student.</span>
<span class="err">The other is meeting potential co-founders.</span>
<span class="err">You have no idea how good of an environment you are in</span>
<span class="err">right now for meeting people that you</span>
<span class="err">can start a company with down the road.</span>
<span class="err">And the one thing that we</span>
<span class="err">always tell college students, is more</span>
<span class="err">important than starting any particular startup</span>
<span class="err">is getting to know a lot of potential co-founders.</span>
<span class="err">So I want to finish this section of my talk</span>
<span class="err">with a quote from 50 Cent.</span>
<span class="err">This is from when he was asked about vitamin water.</span>
<span class="err">I won&#39;t read it, its up there.</span>
<span class="err">But it&#39;s about the importance of</span>
<span class="err">thinking about what customers want, and</span>
<span class="err">thinking about the demands of the market.</span>
<span class="err">Most people don&#39;t do this,</span>
<span class="err">most students especially don&#39;t do this.</span>
<span class="err">If you can just do this one thing, if you can just</span>
<span class="err">learn to think about the market first, you will have</span>
<span class="err">a big leg up on most people starting startups.</span>
<span class="err">All right, and this is something.</span>
<span class="err">This is probably the thing that we</span>
<span class="err">see wrong with Y Combinator apps most frequently, is</span>
<span class="err">that people have not thought about the market first.</span>
<span class="err">And what people want first.</span>
<span class="err">So for the next section,</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;m gonna talk about building a great product.</span>
<span class="err">And here again,</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;m gonna use a very broad definition of product.</span>
<span class="err">It includes customer support and</span>
<span class="err">copyright explaining the product.</span>
<span class="err">Anything involved in your customer&#39;s interaction with</span>
<span class="err">what you built for them.</span>
<span class="err">To build a really great company, you first have to</span>
<span class="err">turn a great idea into a great product.</span>
<span class="err">This is really hard, but it&#39;s crucially important,</span>
<span class="err">and fortunately it&#39;s pretty fun.</span>
<span class="err">Although great products are always new to the world and</span>
<span class="err">it&#39;s hard to give you advice about what to build,</span>
<span class="err">there are enough commonalities that we</span>
<span class="err">can give you a lot of advice about how to build it.</span>
<span class="err">One of the most important tasks for a founder is to</span>
<span class="err">make sure that the company builds a great product.</span>
<span class="err">Until you&#39;ve built a great product,</span>
<span class="err">almost nothing else matters.</span>
<span class="err">When really successful startup founders tell</span>
<span class="err">the story of their early days.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s almost always sitting in front of the computer,</span>
<span class="err">working on their product or talking to their customers.</span>
<span class="err">That&#39;s pretty much all the time.</span>
<span class="err">They do very little else, and</span>
<span class="err">you should be very skeptical if your time allocation is</span>
<span class="err">much different.</span>
<span class="err">Most other problems that founders are trying to</span>
<span class="err">solve, raising money, getting more press,</span>
<span class="err">hiring, business development, et cetera.</span>
<span class="err">These are significantly easier when you</span>
<span class="err">have a great product.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s really important to take care of that first.</span>
<span class="err">Step 1, is to build something that users love.</span>
<span class="err">At YC, we tell founders to work on their product,</span>
<span class="err">talk to users, exercise eat and</span>
<span class="err">sleep and very little else.</span>
<span class="err">All the other stuff I just mentioned, PR conferences,</span>
<span class="err">recruiting advisers, doing partnerships,</span>
<span class="err">you should ignore all of that and</span>
<span class="err">just build a product.</span>
<span class="err">And get it as good as possible by</span>
<span class="err">talking to your users.</span>
<span class="err">Your job is to build something that users love.</span>
<span class="err">Very few companies that go on to be</span>
<span class="err">super successful get there without first doing this.</span>
<span class="err">A lot of good on paper startups fail because they</span>
<span class="err">merely make something that people like.</span>
<span class="err">Making something that people want,</span>
<span class="err">but only a medium amount is a great way to fail and</span>
<span class="err">not understand why you&#39;re failing.</span>
<span class="err">So these are the two jobs.</span>
<span class="err">Something that we say at</span>
<span class="err">YC a lot is that it&#39;s better to build a small number,</span>
<span class="err">it&#39;s better to build something that a small</span>
<span class="err">number of users love than a large number of users like.</span>
<span class="err">Of course, it&#39;d be best to</span>
<span class="err">build something that a small number of users love.</span>
<span class="err">But opportunities to do that for V1 are rare, and</span>
<span class="err">they&#39;re usually not available to startups.</span>
<span class="err">So in practice,</span>
<span class="err">you end up choosing either the grey or the orange.</span>
<span class="err">You make something that a lot of users like a little</span>
<span class="err">bit, or something that a small number of users,</span>
<span class="err">like, love a lot.</span>
<span class="err">And this is a very important piece of advice.</span>
<span class="err">Build something that a small number of users love.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s much easier to expand from something that</span>
<span class="err">a small number of</span>
<span class="err">people love to something that a lot of people love.</span>
<span class="err">Than from something that a lot of</span>
<span class="err">people like to a lot of people love.</span>
<span class="err">If you get this right,</span>
<span class="err">you can get a lot of other things wrong.</span>
<span class="err">If you don&#39;t get this right,</span>
<span class="err">you can get everything else right,</span>
<span class="err">and you&#39;ll probably still fail.</span>
<span class="err">So when you start on a startup, this is the only</span>
<span class="err">thing you need to care about until it&#39;s working.</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; Excuse me, can you explain that again?</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; Sure. So you have</span>
<span class="err">a choice in a startup.</span>
<span class="err">The best thing of all worlds would be to</span>
<span class="err">build a product that a lot of people will really love.</span>
<span class="err">In practice you</span>
<span class="err">can&#39;t usually do that because of big company.</span>
<span class="err">If there&#39;s an opportunity like that, Google or</span>
<span class="err">Facebook will do it.</span>
<span class="err">So there&#39;s like a limit to the area under the curve</span>
<span class="err">of what you can build and you can either build</span>
<span class="err">something that lot of users like a little bit or you can</span>
<span class="err">build something that a small number of users love a lot.</span>
<span class="err">And, like, the total amount of love is the same,</span>
<span class="err">it&#39;s just a question of how it&#39;s distributed.</span>
<span class="err">And there&#39;s like this law of conversation of</span>
<span class="err">how much happiness you can put into the world</span>
<span class="err">with the first product of a startup.</span>
<span class="err">And so startups always struggle with which of</span>
<span class="err">those two they should go.</span>
<span class="err">And they seem equal,</span>
<span class="err">right, cuz the area under the curve is the same.</span>
<span class="err">But we&#39;ve seen this time and again that they&#39;re not.</span>
<span class="err">And that it&#39;s so much easier to expand.</span>
<span class="err">Once you&#39;ve got something that some people love,</span>
<span class="err">you can expand that</span>
<span class="err">something that a lot of other people love.</span>
<span class="err">But if you only get ambivalence or</span>
<span class="err">sort of like weak enthusiasm.</span>
<span class="err">And then try to expand that,</span>
<span class="err">you&#39;ll never get up to a lot of people loving it.</span>
<span class="err">So the advice is, uh, find a small group of users and</span>
<span class="err">make them really love what you&#39;re doing.</span>
<span class="err">Does that make sense?</span>
<span class="err">All right.</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;m, I&#39;m, one way that you know when this is</span>
<span class="err">working is that you&#39;ll get growth by word of mouth.</span>
<span class="err">If you make something people love</span>
<span class="err">people will tell their friends about it.</span>
<span class="err">This works for consumer products and</span>
<span class="err">enterprise products, as well.</span>
<span class="err">When people really love something,</span>
<span class="err">they tell their friends about it and</span>
<span class="err">you&#39;ll see organic growth.</span>
<span class="err">If you find yourself talking about how it&#39;s okay that</span>
<span class="err">you&#39;re not growing because there&#39;s a big partnership</span>
<span class="err">that&#39;s gonna come save you or something like that,</span>
<span class="err">it&#39;s almost always a sign of real trouble.</span>
<span class="err">Sales and marketing are really important, and</span>
<span class="err">we&#39;re gonna have two classes on them later.</span>
<span class="err">But if you don&#39;t have some early organic growth,</span>
<span class="err">then your product probably isn&#39;t good enough yet.</span>
<span class="err">A great product is the secret to</span>
<span class="err">long term growth hacking.</span>
<span class="err">You should get</span>
<span class="err">that right before you worry about anything else.</span>
<span class="err">It doesn&#39;t get easier to put off making a great product.</span>
<span class="err">If you try to build a growth machine before you</span>
<span class="err">have a product that some people really love,</span>
<span class="err">you&#39;re almost certainly gonna waste your time.</span>
<span class="err">Breakout companies almost always have a product</span>
<span class="err">that&#39;s so good that it grows by word of mouth.</span>
<span class="err">Over the long run great products win.</span>
<span class="err">Don&#39;t worry about your competitors raising a lot of</span>
<span class="err">money and what they may do in the future.</span>
<span class="err">They probably aren&#39;t very good anyway.</span>
<span class="err">Very few startups die from competition.</span>
<span class="err">Most die because they themselves fail to</span>
<span class="err">make something users love.</span>
<span class="err">They spend their time on other things.</span>
<span class="err">So worry about this above all else.</span>
<span class="err">Another piece of advice to make something that</span>
<span class="err">users love is to start with something simple.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s much, much easier to make a great product if</span>
<span class="err">you have something simple.</span>
<span class="err">Even if your eventual plans are super complex, and</span>
<span class="err">hopefully they are,</span>
<span class="err">you can almost always start with a smaller subset of</span>
<span class="err">the problem than whatever you think is the smallest.</span>
<span class="err">And it&#39;s hard to build a great product.</span>
<span class="err">So you wanna start with as</span>
<span class="err">little surface area as possible.</span>
<span class="err">Think about the really successful companies and</span>
<span class="err">what they started with.</span>
<span class="err">Think about products that you really love.</span>
<span class="err">They&#39;re generally incredibly simple to use and</span>
<span class="err">especially to get started using.</span>
<span class="err">The first version of</span>
<span class="err">Facebook was almost comically simple.</span>
<span class="err">The first version of Google was just an ugly</span>
<span class="err">webpage with a textbox and two buttons but it returned</span>
<span class="err">the best results, and that&#39;s why users loved it.</span>
<span class="err">The iPhone is far simpler to</span>
<span class="err">use than any smartphone that ever came before it and</span>
<span class="err">it was the first one that people really loved.</span>
<span class="err">Another reason that simple is good,</span>
<span class="err">is because it forces you to do one thing extremely well.</span>
<span class="err">And you have to do that to make</span>
<span class="err">something that people love.</span>
<span class="err">The word fanatical comes up again and</span>
<span class="err">again when you listen to successful founders talk</span>
<span class="err">about how they think about their product.</span>
<span class="err">Founders talk about being fanatical in the way</span>
<span class="err">they care about the quality of the small details.</span>
<span class="err">Fanatical in getting the copy that they use to</span>
<span class="err">explain the product just right and fanatical in</span>
<span class="err">the way they think about customer support.</span>
<span class="err">In fact, one thing that correlates into</span>
<span class="err">success among the YC companies is the founders</span>
<span class="err">that hook up pager duty to their ticketing system, so</span>
<span class="err">that even if the user emails in the middle of</span>
<span class="err">the night when the founders are asleep.</span>
<span class="err">They still get a response within an hour.</span>
<span class="err">Companies actually do this in the early days.</span>
<span class="err">These founders feel physical pain when the product sucks.</span>
<span class="err">And they wanna wake up and fix it.</span>
<span class="err">They don&#39;t ship crap.</span>
<span class="err">And if they do they fix it very, very quickly.</span>
<span class="err">And it definitely takes some level of</span>
<span class="err">fanaticism to build a great product.</span>
<span class="err">You need some users to help with the feedback cycle.</span>
<span class="err">But the way to get those users is manually.</span>
<span class="err">You should go recruit them by hand.</span>
<span class="err">Don&#39;t do things like buy Google ads in</span>
<span class="err">the early days to get initial users.</span>
<span class="err">You don&#39;t need very many.</span>
<span class="err">You just needs ones that will give you feedback every</span>
<span class="err">day and eventually love your product.</span>
<span class="err">So instead of trying to get them on Google AdWords,</span>
<span class="err">just find a few people in the world that will be</span>
<span class="err">good users.</span>
<span class="err">Recruit them by hand.</span>
<span class="err">Ben Silverman when everyone though Pinterest was a joke,</span>
<span class="err">recruited the initial Pinterest users by</span>
<span class="err">tagging up strangers in coffee shops.</span>
<span class="err">He really did. He just walked around</span>
<span class="err">Palo Alto and said will you please use my product.</span>
<span class="err">He also used to run around the Apple store in</span>
<span class="err">Palo Alto.</span>
<span class="err">And he would like set all the browsers to</span>
<span class="err">the Pinterest home page real quick before they caught him</span>
<span class="err">and kicked him out.</span>
<span class="err">So then when people walked in there, they were like oh,</span>
<span class="err">what is this?</span>
<span class="err">This is an important example of doing things</span>
<span class="err">that don&#39;t scale.</span>
<span class="err">If you haven&#39;t read Paul Graham&#39;s essay on</span>
<span class="err">that topic you definitely should.</span>
<span class="err">So get users manually and remember that the goal is to</span>
<span class="err">get a small group of them to love you.</span>
<span class="err">Understand that group extremely well,</span>
<span class="err">get extremely close into them, close to them,</span>
<span class="err">listen to them and you&#39;ll almost always find out</span>
<span class="err">that they&#39;re very willing to give you feedback.</span>
<span class="err">Even if you&#39;re building the product for</span>
<span class="err">yourself, listen to outside users and</span>
<span class="err">they&#39;ll tell you how to make a product they&#39;ll pay for.</span>
<span class="err">Do whatever you need to make them love you,</span>
<span class="err">make you&#39;re doing, cuz they&#39;re also gonna be</span>
<span class="err">the advocates that help you get your next users.</span>
<span class="err">You wanna build an engine in the company that transforms</span>
<span class="err">feedback from users into product decisions then get</span>
<span class="err">it back in front of the users and then repeat.</span>
<span class="err">Ask them what they like and</span>
<span class="err">what they don&#39;t like, and watch them use it.</span>
<span class="err">Ask them what they pay for.</span>
<span class="err">Ask them if they&#39;d be really bummed if</span>
<span class="err">your company went away.</span>
<span class="err">Ask them what would make them recommend the product</span>
<span class="err">to their friends.</span>
<span class="err">And ask them if they&#39;ve recommended it to any yet.</span>
<span class="err">You should make this feedback loop as</span>
<span class="err">tight as possible.</span>
<span class="err">If your product gets 10% better every week,</span>
<span class="err">that compounds really, really quickly.</span>
<span class="err">One of the great advantages of start,</span>
<span class="err">of software startups is just how short you</span>
<span class="err">can make the feedback loop.</span>
<span class="err">It can go circle in hours, and the best</span>
<span class="err">companies usually have the tightest feedback loops.</span>
<span class="err">You should try to keep this going for</span>
<span class="err">all of your company&#39;s life.</span>
<span class="err">But it&#39;s really important in the early days.</span>
<span class="err">The good news is that all of this is doable.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s hard, it takes a lot of effort, but</span>
<span class="err">there&#39;s no magic.</span>
<span class="err">The plan is at least straight forward and</span>
<span class="err">you will eventually get to a great product.</span>
<span class="err">Great founders don&#39;t put</span>
<span class="err">anyone between themselves and their users.</span>
<span class="err">The founders of</span>
<span class="err">these companies do things like sales and</span>
<span class="err">customer support themselves in the early days.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s critical to</span>
<span class="err">get this loop embedded in the culture.</span>
<span class="err">In fact, the specific problem that we</span>
<span class="err">always see with Stanford startups for</span>
<span class="err">some reason is that the students try and</span>
<span class="err">hire sales and customer support people right away.</span>
<span class="err">And you&#39;ve gotta do this yourself.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s the only way.</span>
<span class="err">You really need to use metrics to</span>
<span class="err">keep yourself honest on this.</span>
<span class="err">It really is true that the company will</span>
<span class="err">build whatever the CEO decides to measure.</span>
<span class="err">If you&#39;re building an internet service,</span>
<span class="err">ignore things like total registrations.</span>
<span class="err">Don&#39;t talk about them.</span>
<span class="err">Don&#39;t let anyone in the company talk about them.</span>
<span class="err">And look at growth in active users, activity levels,</span>
<span class="err">cohort retention, revenue, net promoter scores.</span>
<span class="err">These things that matter.</span>
<span class="err">And then be brutally honest if they aren&#39;t going in</span>
<span class="err">the right direction.</span>
<span class="err">Startups live on growth.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s the indicator of a great product.</span>
<span class="err">So this about wraps up</span>
<span class="err">the overview on building a great product.</span>
<span class="err">I wanna emphasize again,</span>
<span class="err">that if you don&#39;t get this right,</span>
<span class="err">nothing else we talk about in the class will matter.</span>
<span class="err">You can basically ignore everything else that we</span>
<span class="err">talked about until this is working well.</span>
<span class="err">On the positive side,</span>
<span class="err">this is one of the most fun parts of building a startup.</span>
<span class="err">So I&#39;m gonna pause here,</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;ll pick back up with the rest of this on Thursday and</span>
<span class="err">now we&#39;re gonna have Dustin talk about why you should</span>
<span class="err">start a startup.</span>
<span class="err">Thank you for coming Dustin.</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; Sure.</span>
<span class="err">But yeah. So Sam asked me</span>
<span class="err">to talk about why you should start a startup.</span>
<span class="err">There&#39;s a bunch of reasons you might have.</span>
<span class="err">And there&#39;s a bunch of common reasons that</span>
<span class="err">people have that I hear all the time for, for</span>
<span class="err">why you might start a startup.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s important to know, like, what reason is yours.</span>
<span class="err">Because some of them only make sense in,</span>
<span class="err">in certain contexts.</span>
<span class="err">Some of them will actually like lead you astray.</span>
<span class="err">You may have been misled by the way that Hollywood or</span>
<span class="err">the press likes to</span>
<span class="err">romanticize entrepreneurship.</span>
<span class="err">So I wanna try and like illuminate you know,</span>
<span class="err">some of those potential fallacies, so</span>
<span class="err">you guys can, can make the decision in a clear way.</span>
<span class="err">And then I&#39;ll talk about the,</span>
<span class="err">the reason I like best for actually starting a startup.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s very related to a lot of what Sam just talked</span>
<span class="err">about but surprisingly I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the most</span>
<span class="err">common reason usually people have one of these other</span>
<span class="err">reasons or they just wanna start up, you know,</span>
<span class="err">start a company for the sake of starting a company.</span>
<span class="err">So the, the four common reasons just to</span>
<span class="err">numerate them are it&#39;s glamorous.</span>
<span class="err">You know, you&#39;ll be, you&#39;ll get to be the boss.</span>
<span class="err">You&#39;ll have flexibility,</span>
<span class="err">especially over your schedule.</span>
<span class="err">And you&#39;ll have the change to have, you know,</span>
<span class="err">bigger impact.</span>
<span class="err">And make more money than you&#39;d,</span>
<span class="err">than you might by joining a later stage company.</span>
<span class="err">So, okay, so uh, you know, you,</span>
<span class="err">you guys are probably pretty familiar with this concept.</span>
<span class="err">When I wrote the Medium post,</span>
<span class="err">which a lot of you guys read a year ago uh, I felt like</span>
<span class="err">the story in the press was a, a little more unbalanced.</span>
<span class="err">You know, entrepreneurship just</span>
<span class="err">got romanticized quite a bit.</span>
<span class="err">You know, the movie, The Social Network,</span>
<span class="err">came out, had a lot of sort of like bad aspects of,</span>
<span class="err">of, you know, what it&#39;s like to be an entrepreneur.</span>
<span class="err">But mainly pa,</span>
<span class="err">sort of painted this picture of like.</span>
<span class="err">There&#39;s a lot of partying and you just</span>
<span class="err">kinda move from like one brilliant insight to another</span>
<span class="err">brilliant insight um, and really made it, you know,</span>
<span class="err">seem like this, like really cool thing to do.</span>
<span class="err">And I think the reality is just, you know,</span>
<span class="err">not quite so glamorous.</span>
<span class="err">There&#39;s sort of a, there&#39;s an ugly side to being</span>
<span class="err">an entrepreneur and also just more importantly what,</span>
<span class="err">what you&#39;re actually spending your time on is,</span>
<span class="err">is just a lot of hard work.</span>
<span class="err">Sam mentioned this, but you&#39;re</span>
<span class="err">basically just sitting at your desk heads down,</span>
<span class="err">focused answering customers, customer support, emails,</span>
<span class="err">doing sales, figuring out hard engineering problems.</span>
<span class="err">So it&#39;s really important that you kind of like,</span>
<span class="err">go in with, with eyes wide open.</span>
<span class="err">And then also it&#39;s, it&#39;s really quite stressful.</span>
<span class="err">This has been a popular topic in the press lately.</span>
<span class="err">The Economist actually ran a story just last week</span>
<span class="err">called like entrepreneurs anonymous, and</span>
<span class="err">shows like a founder kinda like hiding under</span>
<span class="err">his desk And talking about like founder depression.</span>
<span class="err">This is like a very real thing, like, you know,</span>
<span class="err">let&#39;s be real.</span>
<span class="err">This, if you start a company,</span>
<span class="err">it&#39;s gonna be extremely hard.</span>
<span class="err">Why is it so stressful?</span>
<span class="err">So, a couple reasons.</span>
<span class="err">One is you&#39;ve got a lot of responsibility.</span>
<span class="err">So people in any kind of of career have fear of failure.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s kind of just like a dominant part of</span>
<span class="err">the psychology.</span>
<span class="err">But when you&#39;re an entrepreneur your fear of</span>
<span class="err">failure on the behalf of yourself and</span>
<span class="err">all of the people who decided to follow you ah, so</span>
<span class="err">that&#39;s really stressful.</span>
<span class="err">In some cases these people are depending on</span>
<span class="err">you for their livelihood.</span>
<span class="err">Even when that&#39;s not true,</span>
<span class="err">they have decided to devote the,</span>
<span class="err">the best of your, years of their life to following you.</span>
<span class="err">And so you&#39;re responsible for</span>
<span class="err">the opportunity cost of their time.</span>
<span class="err">So that&#39;s a big deal.</span>
<span class="err">And you&#39;re always on call.</span>
<span class="err">If something comes up maybe not always at 3 in</span>
<span class="err">the morning, but for some startups that&#39;s true.</span>
<span class="err">But if something important comes up,</span>
<span class="err">you&#39;re gonna deal with it.</span>
<span class="err">That&#39;s kinda the end of the story.</span>
<span class="err">Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re on vacation.</span>
<span class="err">Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s the weekend.</span>
<span class="err">You kinda always got to be on the ball and</span>
<span class="err">always be in a, in a place, mentally,</span>
<span class="err">where you&#39;re prepared to deal with those things.</span>
<span class="err">And then a sorta special example of that is,</span>
<span class="err">is or of this kind of stress is fundraising.</span>
<span class="err">So a scene from The Social Network.</span>
<span class="err">This is us partying and working at the same time.</span>
<span class="err">And somebody&#39;s spraying champagne everywhere.</span>
<span class="err">You know, so The Social Network spends a lot of</span>
<span class="err">time kind of painting these scenes.</span>
<span class="err">Mark&#39;s not in the scene.</span>
<span class="err">The other thing they spend all their time on is</span>
<span class="err">kind of like painting how, him out to be a huge jerk.</span>
<span class="err">This computer?</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; Yes. Oh.</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; Okay. So.</span>
<span class="err">This is an, an actual scene from um, See it.</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;m gonna move this just a little.</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; Oh, no.</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; This, this will work.</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; This will work. Okay.</span>
<span class="err">On the PDF as well?</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; Yep &gt;&gt; Okay.</span>
<span class="err">Okay, cool. This is</span>
<span class="err">an actual scene from Palo Alto.</span>
<span class="err">Spent a lot of time, his desk,</span>
<span class="err">just kinda heads down and focused.</span>
<span class="err">Mark was still kind or a jerk sometimes, but</span>
<span class="err">in this more like fun loveable way,</span>
<span class="err">not a like sociopathic scorned lover way.</span>
<span class="err">So this is him like, signaling his intention to,</span>
<span class="err">you know, just be focused and keep working.</span>
<span class="err">Not be social.</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; So then there&#39;s also the scene sort of</span>
<span class="err">demonstrating the like brilliant insight moment.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s kind of like straight out of A Beautiful Mind.</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; They literally stole that scene.</span>
<span class="err">So they like to paint it as you just kinda jump from one</span>
<span class="err">of these moments to,</span>
<span class="err">to the other moment with like partying in between,</span>
<span class="err">but really we were just at that table the whole time.</span>
<span class="err">So interestingly if you compare this to</span>
<span class="err">the other photo, Mark is in the exact same position, but</span>
<span class="err">he&#39;s wearing different clothes.</span>
<span class="err">This is definitely a different day.</span>
<span class="err">So cool.</span>
<span class="err">So that&#39;s what it,</span>
<span class="err">that&#39;s what it&#39;s actually like in person.</span>
<span class="err">And I just covered this bullet up here.</span>
<span class="err">This is the Economist article I</span>
<span class="err">was talking about a second ago.</span>
<span class="err">So another form of, of, stress is just,</span>
<span class="err">like, unwanted media a, attention.</span>
<span class="err">So part of it being glamorous is</span>
<span class="err">you get some positive media attention sometimes.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s nice to be on, like,</span>
<span class="err">the cover of Time and, like, be the person of the year.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s maybe a little less nice to be on the cover of</span>
<span class="err">People with, like, one of your wedding photos.</span>
<span class="err">It depends who you are.</span>
<span class="err">Some people would like that.</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;d really hate it.</span>
<span class="err">But when Valleywag like, you know,</span>
<span class="err">analyses your lecture and just tears you apart, like,</span>
<span class="err">you definitely don&#39;t want that.</span>
<span class="err">Nobody wants that.</span>
<span class="err">And then, one thing I almost never hear people talk</span>
<span class="err">about is, you&#39;re just a of more committed.</span>
<span class="err">So if you&#39;re an employee of a startup.</span>
<span class="err">and, you know, things are stressful,</span>
<span class="err">it&#39;s not going well, you&#39;re unhappy, you can just leave.</span>
<span class="err">For a founder you can leave but it&#39;s, it&#39;s very uncool.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s pretty much a black eye on the rest of your career.</span>
<span class="err">And so you really are committed you know, for</span>
<span class="err">ten years if it&#39;s going well probably more</span>
<span class="err">like five years if it&#39;s not going well.</span>
<span class="err">So three years to figure out that it&#39;s not going well and</span>
<span class="err">then if you find, like,</span>
<span class="err">a nice landing for your company,</span>
<span class="err">another two years at the acquiring company.</span>
<span class="err">And if you leave before that,</span>
<span class="err">again, it&#39;s not only gonna harm yourself financially,</span>
<span class="err">it&#39;s gonna harm all your employees.</span>
<span class="err">So you pretty much don&#39;t um, so if you&#39;re lucky, and</span>
<span class="err">you have a bad startup idea you fail quickly um, but</span>
<span class="err">most of the time, it&#39;s not like that.</span>
<span class="err">All right, moving right along um, so.</span>
<span class="err">And I should say,</span>
<span class="err">I have had a lot of this stress in my own life,</span>
<span class="err">especially in the early years of Facebook.</span>
<span class="err">You know, I just got really unhealthy.</span>
<span class="err">I wasn&#39;t exercising.</span>
<span class="err">I had a lot of anxiety.</span>
<span class="err">Actually, I threw out my back, like,</span>
<span class="err">almost every six months, like,</span>
<span class="err">when I was like, 21, 22.</span>
<span class="err">Which was, like, pretty crazy.</span>
<span class="err">And so, if you do start a company.</span>
<span class="err">make, you know,</span>
<span class="err">be aware that you&#39;re gonna have to deal with this and</span>
<span class="err">you have to actually manage it.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s actually, like, one of your core responsibilities.</span>
<span class="err">Ben Horowitz likes to say, like, the number one rule of</span>
<span class="err">a CEO is managing your own psychology.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s absolutely true, make sure you do it.</span>
<span class="err">so, another reason so people especially if</span>
<span class="err">they&#39;ve already had a job at another company.</span>
<span class="err">You tend to develop this narrative of like,</span>
<span class="err">okay like,</span>
<span class="err">the people running this company are idiots,</span>
<span class="err">they&#39;re making all these stupid decisions,</span>
<span class="err">they&#39;re spending their time in, in these stupid ways.</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;m gonna start a company and I&#39;m gonna do it better.</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;m gonna like, set all the rules.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s a pretty attractive idea.</span>
<span class="err">Makes a lot of sense.</span>
<span class="err">If you&#39;ve read my</span>
<span class="err">Medium posts you know what&#39;s coming.</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;ll give you guys a second to read this quote.</span>
<span class="err">Cool. So this,</span>
<span class="err">this really resonates with me.</span>
<span class="err">And one thing I&#39;d point out is you know, the reality of</span>
<span class="err">these decisions is pretty nu, nuanced.</span>
<span class="err">The people you thought were</span>
<span class="err">idiots probably weren&#39;t idiots.</span>
<span class="err">They probably just had like</span>
<span class="err">a really difficult decision in front of them.</span>
<span class="err">And people pulling them in multiple directions.</span>
<span class="err">So the most common thing I have to spend my time on.</span>
<span class="err">And, and focus my energy on as a CEO is like.</span>
<span class="err">The, the problems that</span>
<span class="err">like other people are bringing to me.</span>
<span class="err">The, the other priorities that people create.</span>
<span class="err">And it&#39;s usually in the form of a conflict.</span>
<span class="err">People wanna go in different directions.</span>
<span class="err">Or like customers want different things.</span>
<span class="err">And like I might have my own opinion about that.</span>
<span class="err">But really the, the game I&#39;m</span>
<span class="err">playing is like who do I disappoint the least?</span>
<span class="err">And like just trying to like navigate all,</span>
<span class="err">all these difficult situations.</span>
<span class="err">And even on a day to day basis I might come in</span>
<span class="err">on Monday and like have all these, you know,</span>
<span class="err">grand plans for like how I&#39;m gonna improve</span>
<span class="err">the company and what I&#39;m gonna spend my time on, but</span>
<span class="err">then if like an important employee is threatening to</span>
<span class="err">quit, that&#39;s what I&#39;m spending my time on.</span>
<span class="err">That&#39;s my number one priority.</span>
<span class="err">So a subset of you&#39;re</span>
<span class="err">the boss is you have flexibility.</span>
<span class="err">You have control over your own schedule.</span>
<span class="err">This really attractive idea.</span>
<span class="err">So here&#39;s the reality.</span>
<span class="err">And their Phil Libin quote.</span>
<span class="err">So this, this truly reson, resonates with me as well.</span>
<span class="err">And some of the reasons for</span>
<span class="err">this, again, you&#39;re always on call.</span>
<span class="err">So maybe you don&#39;t intend to work all parts of</span>
<span class="err">the day but you might not get to control which ones.</span>
<span class="err">You&#39;re a role model, this is super important.</span>
<span class="err">So if you&#39;re an employee of a company um, you might have</span>
<span class="err">some good weeks, you might have some bad weeks,</span>
<span class="err">some weeks when you&#39;re, you&#39;re low energy, maybe you</span>
<span class="err">wanna take a couple extra days off um, that&#39;s really</span>
<span class="err">bad if you&#39;re, you&#39;re an entrepreneur like your team</span>
<span class="err">will really signal off what your bringing to the table.</span>
<span class="err">And so if you take your foot off the gas, so will they.</span>
<span class="err">And you&#39;re always working anyway.</span>
<span class="err">So, if you&#39;re really passionate about an idea,</span>
<span class="err">it&#39;s just gonna like pull you to,</span>
<span class="err">to keep working on it.</span>
<span class="err">If you&#39;re working with great investors,</span>
<span class="err">you&#39;re working with great partners,</span>
<span class="err">they&#39;re gonna wanna be working really hard,</span>
<span class="err">they&#39;re gonna want you to be working really hard uh, and</span>
<span class="err">again, you&#39;re gonna wanna work really hard.</span>
<span class="err">So some some companies like to tell the story about you</span>
<span class="err">can have your cake and eat it too, you can have, like,</span>
<span class="err">four day week, work weeks maybe if you&#39;re, if you&#39;re,</span>
<span class="err">Tim Ferris maybe you can have a 12-hour work week.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s a really attractive idea and</span>
<span class="err">it does work in a particular instance.</span>
<span class="err">Which is if you wanna like actually have a small</span>
<span class="err">business or go after a niche market.</span>
<span class="err">Then you&#39;re a small business entrepreneur.</span>
<span class="err">That makes total sense.</span>
<span class="err">But as soon as you get past like two or</span>
<span class="err">three people uh, you really need to step it up and, and</span>
<span class="err">be full time committed.</span>
<span class="err">cool.</span>
<span class="err">So, this is the big one this is the, the one I</span>
<span class="err">hear the most especially like candidates applying to</span>
<span class="err">a Asana they tell me, you know, I,</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;d really like to work for, for</span>
<span class="err">a much smaller company, or start my own because.</span>
<span class="err">Then I have a much bigger slice of the pie,</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;ll have much more impact on how that company does and</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;ll have more equity so</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;ll make more money as well.</span>
<span class="err">So let&#39;s examine when this might be true.</span>
<span class="err">So I&#39;ll explain these tables they&#39;re a little complex but</span>
<span class="err">let&#39;s focus on the left first so these is,</span>
<span class="err">this is just explaining.</span>
<span class="err">Dropbox and Facebook.</span>
<span class="err">These are their current valuations.</span>
<span class="err">And this is how much money you might</span>
<span class="err">make as employee number 100 coming into these companies.</span>
<span class="err">Especially if you&#39;re like, an experience,</span>
<span class="err">a relatively experienced engineer, like,</span>
<span class="err">you have five years of, of industry experience.</span>
<span class="err">You&#39;re pretty likely to</span>
<span class="err">have an offer that&#39;s around 10 basis points.</span>
<span class="err">So if you joined DropBox a couple years ago,</span>
<span class="err">the upside you&#39;d have already locked in.</span>
<span class="err">As about ten million,</span>
<span class="err">there&#39;s plenty more growth from there.</span>
<span class="err">If you leave the company if you joined Facebook a couple</span>
<span class="err">years into its,</span>
<span class="err">its existence you made $200 million.</span>
<span class="err">This is a huge number.</span>
<span class="err">And if you.</span>
<span class="err">Even if you joined Facebook as employee number 1,000.</span>
<span class="err">So you joined it in like 2009 you still</span>
<span class="err">made $20 million.</span>
<span class="err">That&#39;s a giant number.</span>
<span class="err">And that&#39;s how you should be benchmarking when you&#39;re</span>
<span class="err">thinking about what might I make as an entrepreneur.</span>
<span class="err">So moving over to the table on the right uh,</span>
<span class="err">these are two theoretical companies you might start.</span>
<span class="err">So Uber for Pet Sitting, pretty good idea.</span>
<span class="err">If you&#39;re, if you&#39;re really well suited to this,</span>
<span class="err">you might have, uh, a really good shot at</span>
<span class="err">building a $100 million company.</span>
<span class="err">And then your share of that company is pretty likely to</span>
<span class="err">be about 10%.</span>
<span class="err">That certainly fluctuates.</span>
<span class="err">Some founders have a lot more than this,</span>
<span class="err">some have a lot less.</span>
<span class="err">But after multiple rounds of dilution multiple rounds of</span>
<span class="err">option table, option pool creation,</span>
<span class="err">you&#39;re pretty likely to end up about here.</span>
<span class="err">If you have more than this,</span>
<span class="err">I recommend Sam&#39;s post on like the equity split</span>
<span class="err">between founders and employees.</span>
<span class="err">You probably should be giving out more.</span>
<span class="err">And then but so basically, if you&#39;re extremely</span>
<span class="err">confident about building this $100 million business,</span>
<span class="err">which is a big ask it should go without saying that</span>
<span class="err">you should have a lot more confidence than Facebook in</span>
<span class="err">2009 or Dropbox in 2014 and</span>
<span class="err">you might, for a start up that doesn&#39;t even exist yet.</span>
<span class="err">Then this is worth hearing.</span>
<span class="err">So if you have a $100 million idea and</span>
<span class="err">you&#39;re pretty confident you can execute it,</span>
<span class="err">I would consider that.</span>
<span class="err">If you think you&#39;re the right entrepreneur to build</span>
<span class="err">Uber, Uber for space travel, that&#39;s really huge idea.</span>
<span class="err">$2 billion idea.</span>
<span class="err">You&#39;re actually gonna have a pretty good return for that.</span>
<span class="err">You should definitely do that.</span>
<span class="err">This is also only the value after four years.</span>
<span class="err">And this idea probably has legs.</span>
<span class="err">So definitely go after that.</span>
<span class="err">If, if you&#39;re thinking of building that,</span>
<span class="err">you probably shouldn&#39;t even be in this class right now.</span>
<span class="err">You should go and, go and build that company.</span>
<span class="err">So why is this, financial reward and, and impact, I</span>
<span class="err">really think that financial reward is very strongly</span>
<span class="err">correlated with the impact you have on the world.</span>
<span class="err">If you don&#39;t believe that let&#39;s talk</span>
<span class="err">through some specific examples and</span>
<span class="err">not think about the equity at all.</span>
<span class="err">So why might joining a, a late-stage company actually</span>
<span class="err">provide you a lot of impact?</span>
<span class="err">You get this multiplier They have an existing massive</span>
<span class="err">user base.</span>
<span class="err">If it&#39;s Facebook, it&#39;s a billion users.</span>
<span class="err">Or if it&#39;s Google it&#39;s a billion users.</span>
<span class="err">They have existing infrastructure you</span>
<span class="err">get to build on.</span>
<span class="err">That&#39;s also increasingly true for new startups.</span>
<span class="err">Things like AWS.</span>
<span class="err">Like awesome independent service providers.</span>
<span class="err">But you usually get some, like,</span>
<span class="err">proprietary technology and it&#39;s all maintained for you.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s a pretty great place to start uh, and</span>
<span class="err">you get to work with a team and they&#39;ll help you</span>
<span class="err">just leverage your idea into something great.</span>
<span class="err">So, a couple of specific examples Bret Taylor came</span>
<span class="err">into employee around or</span>
<span class="err">came into Google as around employee number 1,500.</span>
<span class="err">And he invented Google Maps.</span>
<span class="err">This is a product you guys probably use every day.</span>
<span class="err">I used it to get here.</span>
<span class="err">And it&#39;s used by hundreds of millions of</span>
<span class="err">people all around the world.</span>
<span class="err">Didn&#39;t need to start a company to do that,</span>
<span class="err">did happen to get a big financial reward.</span>
<span class="err">But the, the point is he had massive impact.</span>
<span class="err">My co-founder Justin Rosenstein.</span>
<span class="err">Joined go, Google a little later after Brad he was</span>
<span class="err">a PM there.</span>
<span class="err">And just as a side project he</span>
<span class="err">ended up prototyping a chat which, which used to be</span>
<span class="err">a standalone app as integrated into Gmail,</span>
<span class="err">like you see it on the upper right there.</span>
<span class="err">And before he did that, like people didn&#39;t even think you</span>
<span class="err">could do chat over AJAX, or chat in the browser at all,</span>
<span class="err">and he just kind of like demonstrated it, and</span>
<span class="err">showed it to his team, and made it happen.</span>
<span class="err">Again, this is probably a product most of</span>
<span class="err">you use maybe every day.</span>
<span class="err">And then, perhaps even more impressively,</span>
<span class="err">shortly after that,.</span>
<span class="err">JR left,</span>
<span class="err">he became employee around number 250 at Facebook.</span>
<span class="err">And he led a hack-a-thon project along with</span>
<span class="err">people like Andrew Bosworth and</span>
<span class="err">Leah Pearlman uh, to create the like button.</span>
<span class="err">So, this is one of the most popular elements anywhere</span>
<span class="err">on the web.</span>
<span class="err">Totally changes how people use it.</span>
<span class="err">And again didn&#39;t need to start a company to do it and</span>
<span class="err">almost certainly would have failed if he had tried.</span>
<span class="err">Because he really needed the distribution of</span>
<span class="err">Facebook to make it work.</span>
<span class="err">So important to, to keep in mind the context for uh,</span>
<span class="err">what kind of company you&#39;re trying to start and like,</span>
<span class="err">where will you actually be able to make it happen.</span>
<span class="err">So what&#39;s the best reason?</span>
<span class="err">So, Sam already talked about this a little bit but</span>
<span class="err">basically, you can&#39;t not do it.</span>
<span class="err">You&#39;re super passionate about this idea.</span>
<span class="err">You&#39;re the right person to do it.</span>
<span class="err">You&#39;ve gotta make it happen.</span>
<span class="err">So how does this break down?</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; Cuz we&#39;re getting close to end here.</span>
<span class="err">How am I doing on time?</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; Cool.</span>
<span class="err">Sweet. Perfect.</span>
<span class="err">So this, this is sort of like a word play.</span>
<span class="err">You can&#39;t not do it in two ways.</span>
<span class="err">One is, you&#39;re so</span>
<span class="err">passionate about it that you&#39;re just like,</span>
<span class="err">you have to do it.</span>
<span class="err">You&#39;re gonna do it anyway.</span>
<span class="err">And this is really important.</span>
<span class="err">Cuz you&#39;ll need that passion to get through all of</span>
<span class="err">those like hard parts of</span>
<span class="err">being an entrepreneur that we talked about earlier.</span>
<span class="err">You&#39;ll also need it to effectively recruit.</span>
<span class="err">Candidates can smell when you don&#39;t have passion.</span>
<span class="err">And there are enough entrepreneurs out there who</span>
<span class="err">do have passion.</span>
<span class="err">That they may as well work for one of those.</span>
<span class="err">So this is sort of like table stakes for</span>
<span class="err">being an entrepreneur.</span>
<span class="err">Your subconscious can also tell when you</span>
<span class="err">don&#39;t have passion and that&#39;ll be a huge problem.</span>
<span class="err">And then so the other way to interpret this is the world</span>
<span class="err">needs you to do it.</span>
<span class="err">So this is sort of</span>
<span class="err">validation that the idea is important.</span>
<span class="err">It&#39;s gonna make the world better, so</span>
<span class="err">the world needs it.</span>
<span class="err">If it&#39;s not em, if it&#39;s not something the world needs,</span>
<span class="err">go do something the world needs.</span>
<span class="err">Your time&#39;s really valuable. Um,</span>
<span class="err">there are plenty good ideas out there.</span>
<span class="err">Maybe it&#39;s not one of your own.</span>
<span class="err">Maybe it&#39;s an existing company.</span>
<span class="err">But you may as well work on</span>
<span class="err">something that&#39;s gonna be good.</span>
<span class="err">And then the second way to</span>
<span class="err">interpret this is the world needs you to do it.</span>
<span class="err">You&#39;re actually well suited to this problem in some way.</span>
<span class="err">If this isn&#39;t true it may be a sign that</span>
<span class="err">your time is better spent somewhere else.</span>
<span class="err">But also just best case scenario if this isn&#39;t true,</span>
<span class="err">you out compete the team for which it is true.</span>
<span class="err">And you just end</span>
<span class="err">up with like a sub-optimal outcome for the world.</span>
<span class="err">That doesn&#39;t feel very good.</span>
<span class="err">So drawing this back to my own experience at Asana,</span>
<span class="err">you know, Justin and</span>
<span class="err">I were kind of like reluctant entrepreneurs.</span>
<span class="err">We, before we founded Asana so</span>
<span class="err">we&#39;re working at Facebook.</span>
<span class="err">We were already working on a great problem.</span>
<span class="err">And we would basically work all day</span>
<span class="err">long on our normal projects and</span>
<span class="err">then at night we would keep working on this internal</span>
<span class="err">task manager that was used internally at the company.</span>
<span class="err">And it was just cuz we were like so</span>
<span class="err">passionate about the idea that was so</span>
<span class="err">clearly valuable, that we couldn&#39;t do anything else.</span>
<span class="err">And at some point we had to have the hard</span>
<span class="err">conversation of like, okay well what does it</span>
<span class="err">mean if we don&#39;t actually start this company.</span>
<span class="err">We were pretty, we were able to</span>
<span class="err">see the impact it was having on Facebook.</span>
<span class="err">We were pretty convinced it</span>
<span class="err">could be really valuable for the world.</span>
<span class="err">We were also pretty</span>
<span class="err">convinced nobody else was gonna build it.</span>
<span class="err">The problem had been around a long time and</span>
<span class="err">we just kept seeing sort of incremental solutions to it.</span>
<span class="err">So if we didn&#39;t go out with the one that we</span>
<span class="err">thought was best,</span>
<span class="err">we thought there&#39;d be a lot of value left on the table.</span>
<span class="err">And yeah.</span>
<span class="err">So we just couldn&#39;t, couldn&#39;t stop working on it.</span>
<span class="err">And literally the idea was like beating itself out of</span>
<span class="err">our chest, like forcing itself into the world.</span>
<span class="err">And I think that&#39;s the feeling you should really be</span>
<span class="err">looking for when you start a company.</span>
<span class="err">That&#39;s how you know you have the right idea.</span>
<span class="err">So I&#39;ll go ahead and stop there.</span>
<span class="err">I&#39;ll put some recommended books up here,</span>
<span class="err">but won&#39;t narrate them.</span>
<span class="err">And maybe, that&#39;s the end of the class.</span>
<span class="err">&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you.</span>
<span class="err">Maybe you guys could stick around for</span>
<span class="err">a few minutes if you have questions for him.</span>
<span class="err">And uh, see you Thursday.</span>
<span class="err">Thank you.</span>
